## :dart: Overview

<p>
To-do-app is a React application focusing on personal routine management. Here you are able to create, delete and toggle your tasks without any problem using a stylish interface.
</p>

<p>
It is the 2nd app version I made. The 1st app version was my first complete React project, in which I learned a lot of things about coding, so I decided to make a better version.
